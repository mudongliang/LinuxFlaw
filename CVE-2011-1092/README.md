## PoCs

[PHP 5.3.6 - 'shmop_read()' Integer Overflow Denial of Service](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16966/)

[Integer overflow in shmop_read()](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54193)

## Vulnerability Details & Patch

### Root Cause

The problem is in the shmop_read php function, in the file
ext/shmop/shmop.c. This functions reads a given number of bytes from
memory, at a given offset starting from a shared memory area.

string shmop_read (int shmid, int start, int count)

Inside the code of the function itself, there are checks in the start
parameter and in the count parameter, to avoid reading arbitrary
memory outside the shared memory object:

    if (start < 0 || start > shmop->size) {
        php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, "start is out of range");
        RETURN_FALSE;
    }

    if (start + count > shmop->size || count < 0) {
        php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, "count is out of range");
        RETURN_FALSE;
    }

The first block check if start is lower than 0 or bigger than the size
of the shared memory area.

The second block checks that the SUM (ADDITION) of "start" and "count"
is not greater than the shared memory area, and later checks if count
its not lower than 0.
