        Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil
        in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a
        government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamities is heightened by
        reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer! Government, like dress, is the badge of
        lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were
        the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other
        lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property
        to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which
        in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true
        design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to
        ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.
