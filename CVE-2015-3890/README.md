## Vulnerability Details & Patch

### Root Cause

By sending a crafted request, an attacker may trigger an out-of-bounds memory read, resulting in a segmentation
fault and server crash. This is due to a portion of memory being referenced by the application after being freed.
The second parameter (p) to the memmove() call (line 741, httpreq.cpp) within the HttpReq::newKeyValueBuf
method results in an out of bounds memory read when attacker submits a crafted HTTP request. This is due to the
portion of memory the ‘p’ parameter resides in being freed by a realloc() call. The reallocation is performed by the
allocate() method of the AutoBuf class. This is triggered by the call to AutoBuf’s grow() method within the
newKeyValueBuf method (line 736, httpreq.cpp).
